If you're seeing this you've likely stumbled somewhere weird. This is a personal project I hope to release someday but in the interest of people potentially helping me, here's the ideas for the mod:
This started because I was frustrated with inventory management and a lack of QoL options when 'adventuring'. There's a lot of mods for minecraft that improve your base but most 'inventory' management and navigation is locked to mid or late game.
Thus, I've begun compiling things I've thought of or wished I had in some vague way.
I don't know much about licensing but feel free to steal the ideas and do what you like with them, hell even my sprites/textures. It's probably the most decent thing I've made.

Item 1 - Barrel of Boats

A barrel banded in waves that holds a nigh infinite amount of boats.
  #Texture created, this part is done. However as a multiple state block it's not formatted correctly

Right clicking water will result in a temporary boat being spawned that will crumble into sticks within 30 seconds of the player leaving it.
  #No idea how to do this yet, still working my way up.

Shift right clicking any block will place the barrel, allowing it to be opened. Each opening of the barrel generates 6 to 18 random regular, permanent minecraft boats, including chest & furnace boats. Boats can go into the barrel but nothing else can. When closed, the inventory will reshuffle.
  #Again, no idea how to do this.

The barrel loses durability when it is placed or used which can be fixed by crafting it with a boat.
  #Not a clue

When the barrel is picked up it should always drop the regular barrel of boats and never its inventory.
  #Slight clue, though not tested yet.

Item 2 - Planter's Satchel

A large saddle-like sack with seeds as its drawstring tassles.
  #No texture created

This bag works like a bundle, holding up to 64 stacks of 8-stack, unique seeds.
  #Will likely copy/modify bundle code.

Seeds and saplings automatically enter the bag, it works like a bundle or backpack.
  #I know this is possible, whitelists and blacklists, though making it mod compatible I'm not sure.

You can open the sack to access its inventory
  #Some idea how to do this.

You can right click farmland to sow random seeds in the bag OR dirt to sow random saplings.
  #No idea how to do this.

Item 3 - Black Mirror
Combines different info items and makes f3 menu accessible in game.

Compass - Shows worldspawn, home, north, or bed.
Depth Meter - Shows Y level. Mirror changes view as descent but also prints y level on right click
Clock - Shows time in visual quarters, also prints exact time when right clicked.
Radar - Shows number of entities within x range as a number. Red dot sprite grows brighter when more entities are around.
Lumimeter - Shows light level by growing brighter, also prints light level when right clicked.
Biome - Shows a little sprite painting of what biome, also prints exact biome name
Pet mode - Random faces and sprites. A default/for fun addition saved for the end.
